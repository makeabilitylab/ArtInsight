This artwork is a vibrant and expressive painting that fills most of the vertical paper. The dominant color is a rich, deep blue that covers the upper two-thirds of the painting in broad, sweeping strokes. This blue area has a rounded, almost circular shape, giving the impression of a large, blue body or form. Below this, the lower third of the painting is primarily composed of dark green and black strokes, creating a sense of ground or foundation.

There are interesting details within the painting that add depth and intrigue. On the left side of the blue area, there's a small black shape that could be interpreted as a bird or another small creature. On the right side, there's a splash of yellow and brown that stands out against the blue, perhaps suggesting a face or another feature within the larger blue form.

The brushstrokes are bold and energetic, showing confidence in the application of paint. The artist has used a mix of broad strokes for the main areas and some finer details in places, creating a dynamic and lively composition. The overall effect is one of movement and energy, with the blue form seeming to dominate the space in an almost creature-like manner.

At the top left corner of the paper, there appears to be some light pencil writing, but I won't make assumptions about what it says. This artwork shows great creativity and a strong sense of color and form, demonstrating your child's artistic expression and imagination.
