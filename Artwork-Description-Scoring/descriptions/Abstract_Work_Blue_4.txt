This artwork is full of vibrant colors! The main colors are blue, green, yellow, and brown. The blue takes up most of the space in the picture, and the green, yellow, and brown are concentrated on the right side of the artwork. There is a lot of interesting texture created by the way the paint was applied. You can see long, sweeping strokes of blue, and the green has a more swirling pattern. The yellow and brown seem to form a long, narrow shape, almost like a stalk or a stem. It's exciting to see how your child used such bold colors and interesting shapes in their artwork. What do you think about this piece, and do you know what your child wanted to represent?
