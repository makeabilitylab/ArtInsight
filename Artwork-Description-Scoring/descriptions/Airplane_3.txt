Your child's artwork depicts a beautifully detailed airplane flying through the sky. The plane is drawn in a side view orientation, showcasing its structure clearly. The main body of the airplane is shaded in gray, with careful attention paid to elements like windows, wings, and landing gears.

The airplane features a series of rectangular windows along its side, each filled in with blue to represent the plane's interior. At the front, there's a cockpit window outlined in black and filled in with blue. The wings and tail have accents of blue and yellow, adding some vibrant color to the otherwise gray airplane.

The landing gears, positioned below the wings, have dark wheels with red struts, and the propellers or engine covers are also visible. The details and color choices bring the airplane to life, suggesting movement and flight. The background of the artwork is left plain, which further focuses attention on the plane itself.

Overall, it's a lovely and thoughtful rendition of an airplane, showing a good understanding of the different parts of the aircraft and a nice use of color to bring it all together.
