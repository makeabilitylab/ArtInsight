This is a beautiful drawing of an airplane! It's a gray airplane with yellow and blue details. The airplane is flying in the sky, and you can see its wings, tail, and wheels.  There are a few windows on the side of the airplane, and you can even see the door to get inside. It looks like a very powerful airplane! I love how you've captured the details.  It looks like it might be getting ready to land. Is this airplane landing or taking off? What kind of airplane is it?
