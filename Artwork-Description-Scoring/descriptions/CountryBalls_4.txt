This is a very colorful drawing! It looks like a scene with lots of round, colorful balls. There's a big one at the top, with red, blue, and white stripes, and two little black circles.  There is a yellow sun with a black dot in the corner, and long, thin black lines extending down the page. Underneath the large ball, there are five more balls lined up. The first one is blue and yellow, the next is yellow, red, and black. The third is orange, green, and blue. The fourth is white, blue, and red, and the last one is red and white. The balls are all on a green line at the bottom of the page. Between each ball, there are black shapes that look like bent L shapes. Above the title, there are two more black L shapes, and to the left of the big ball, there is a black shape that might be a table or another kind of structure. What do you think?  What did your child draw?
