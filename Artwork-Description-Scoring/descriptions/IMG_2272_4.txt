Your child made a colorful and interesting artwork!  The main figure in the artwork is a large, dark gray shape in the center. It's hard to say for sure what it is, but it might be a person or animal.  The figure is surrounded by other colorful shapes and lines in various shades of pink, red, and yellow.  There are also three thin, vertical lines in green, orange, and purple. At the top of the artwork, there is the word "HOR" written in purple, which might be part of a word.  There is a lot of white space in the artwork, and the paper appears to be slightly wrinkled.  Do you know what your child was thinking about when they made this artwork?
