Your child has created a vibrant and charming illustration of a bird. The bird is drawn with a bright yellow body and represents a stylized, cartoonish appearance. The outline of the bird is defined with bold black lines, giving it a distinct and clear shape. The bird has a large, expressive eye colored in black, giving it a lively look. The beak is colored orange, standing out against the yellow body. The wing is drawn with a simple outline and filled with the same yellow color as the rest of the body. The tail consists of three pointed feathers, also outlined in black.

The background is a soft blue color, creating a gentle sky-like effect, and there are hints of purple at the bottom, which might represent the ground or a shadow. The overall tone of the artwork is cheerful and playful, capturing a delightful sense of imagination and creativity. The use of color and bold lines showcases your child's attention to detail and artistic style.
