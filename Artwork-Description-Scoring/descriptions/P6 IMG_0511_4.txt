This is a very colorful and interesting piece of artwork!  It appears to be a drawing of a yellow bird or duck with a bright orange beak. The bird's head is turned to the left side of the paper, and the bird's body is facing the right side. The bird is outlined in black, and it looks like there are some details of the bird's feathers shown by black lines on its body. The bird is sitting on a patch of purple grass. The background is a light blue color with some white accents. It looks like there was also some water added to the paper as the colors are a bit blurry in spots. What a fun piece of art! Do you want to talk more about it?
