This is a very colorful piece of artwork! It looks like your child made a fish out of paper and added colorful foam shapes around it. The fish is outlined in black and is filled with different colors including yellow, orange, green, purple, blue, and red. The fish has a yellow tail and fins, and it is facing to the right. The foam shapes come in different colors, including yellow, blue, red, and orange, and they are all arranged in a random pattern around the fish. There are a lot of shapes - it's hard to say exactly how many! The artwork is on a black background.
