This vibrant and imaginative drawing features several interesting elements that come together to create a lively scene. On the left side, there is a green Christmas tree adorned with colorful baubles and topped with a golden star. Next to the tree stands a unique character, possibly a whimsical representation of a snowman. This figure has a joyful face, and its body consists of two segments: the upper half is colored red and the lower half is yellow. It has black stick-like arms and legs, and wears a black hat with a red flower or decoration on top.

To the right of the snowman, there's a large, purple and white animal figure, which could be a zebra given the stripes. This zebra is drawn in a side profile and features a smiling face with large, expressive eyes. Black stripes are noticeable along the body and legs.

The setting includes a gentle, wavy blue line beneath the figures, suggesting a ground line or perhaps a hint of water. The overall color usage—bold greens, reds, purples, and yellows—adds to the joyous and playful atmosphere of the scene.

Your child's artwork seems to express a fun and imaginative approach, possibly blending elements of winter or holiday themes with imaginative creatures, providing a bright and engaging visual story.
