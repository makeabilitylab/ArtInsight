Your child's artwork is vibrant and whimsical with a holiday theme. On the left side of the page, there is a decorated Christmas tree drawn in green with round ornaments in varied colors. The tree is topped with a small, yellow star. Next to the tree, there is a figure drawn with a yellow face and a red body. The figure has large eyes and a big smile, detailed with black arms and legs. The figure is wearing a hat that appears to be a Santa hat, with a black and white design ending with a red pom-pom. 

Beside this cheerful character, there is an interesting addition in the form of a cut-out drawing glued to the paper. The cut-out depicts an animal-like creature with a white face and black features, including long ears and a boxed-in snout. Its body is colored in purple with black lines to represent legs and other detailing, resembling a stylized horse or donkey. The ground is marked by a wavy teal line at the bottom of the illustration, suggesting grass or ground.

Overall, the artwork is cheerful and colorful, showcasing a festive scene with a touch of creative imagination.
