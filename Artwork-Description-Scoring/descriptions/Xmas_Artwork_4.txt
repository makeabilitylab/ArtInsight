This is a very colorful and creative artwork! There are three main figures in the picture. One is a green Christmas tree with a yellow star on top, with some red and blue circles that look like ornaments. The tree is on the left side of the picture.  In the middle is a person with red clothing and black arms and legs. The person has a yellow face, a big smile, and a red hat with a yellow pom-pom. The person has their arms raised up in the air. On the right side of the picture, there is a large purple figure with black legs and arms. It looks like the figure is walking or running. This figure has a round head with a white face and two black eyes. There are also some green and purple markings around the figure.  There is a wavy blue line at the bottom of the picture. It looks like a lot of fun was had making this!  Do you know what the artist wanted to show us with this picture?
