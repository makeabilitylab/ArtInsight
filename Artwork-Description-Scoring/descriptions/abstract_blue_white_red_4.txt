The artwork is on a dark blue background, and there are two large white areas in the top half of the paper.  In the right-hand white area, there is a figure in a red robe with a pointed hood. The figure is facing towards the left side of the paper, and the white area surrounding it has several white streaks that look like brushstrokes.  The white areas look like clouds, and maybe this is a scene in the sky? What do you think?
