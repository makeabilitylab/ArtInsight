This is a wonderful piece! It appears to be a drawing of a dog on a dark background, most likely a black chalkboard or paper. The dog is a bulldog, which we can tell by its short snout, wrinkles, and large, floppy ears. The artist has captured lots of detail in the dog's fur by using short, scratchy lines throughout the drawing, which gives it a fuzzy look. There's a bit of shading on the nose and eyes, and the dog's mouth is open with its tongue showing.  The artist has used white chalk or crayon to create the image on the dark background, which gives it a strong contrast.  It looks like you have a budding artist on your hands!
