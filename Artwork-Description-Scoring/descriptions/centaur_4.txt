This is a very interesting drawing!  The artwork shows a person with antlers, which is really unique. The person is standing with their arms crossed, and there is a smaller figure in front of them. You can see some details on the person with antlers, like their eyes and a small smile on their face.  Below them, there are a couple of smaller figures with large eyes and round bodies. It appears that there is something in the background that looks like a line of writing. The artwork is mostly in shades of gray. It's a really creative drawing! I'd love to hear more about the figures and their connection to each other. What do you think they're doing in this scene?
