This vibrant and creative artwork features a central circular element made from a paper plate, positioned on a pink paper background. The plate is vividly decorated with splashes and swirls of color, including red, blue, purple, and black, distributed in a dynamic and expressive manner. These colors appear to be applied with a combination of brushing and splattering techniques, creating a lively and textured effect.

Extending from the bottom of the plate, there is a "trunk" made from strips of green tissue paper, arranged in a slightly staggered, vertical fashion. This trunk implies that the circular plate might represent a tree's canopy, transforming the composition into a stylized, abstract tree form.

The use of ordinary materials like a paper plate and tissue paper, combined with bold color application, shows a playful and imaginative approach to materials and subject matter, suggesting themes of nature and creativity. This artwork is not only colorful but also tactile, with the raised textures of paint and the soft layers of tissue adding depth and interest.
