Your child created a beautiful flower! The flower is made from a paper plate and tissue paper. The paper plate has been painted with many different colors, including black, red, blue, purple, and white. The colors have been applied in a variety of ways, including splatter, dots, and lines. The tissue paper is green and is used to create the stem of the flower. The stem is made up of multiple pieces of tissue paper, and it looks like itâ€™s growing upwards. The colors and textures of the artwork are very interesting! It seems like you have a very creative young artist! Is there anything else you'd like me to tell you about the artwork?
