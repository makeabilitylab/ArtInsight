This artwork is a charming pencil sketch featuring two whimsical characters. The drawing is done on what appears to be lined paper, giving it a casual, spontaneous feel. 

At the top of the image, there's a peculiar creature with a large, prominent eye. This character has a body that resembles a ribcage or accordion-like structure. It has wing-like appendages on one side and what looks like an arm or leg on the other. Above this creature, the word "Hello!" is written, suggesting it might be greeting the viewer or the other character in the drawing.

Below this top figure is another character. This one has a more humanoid appearance with a round head, two large circular eyes, and a small mouth. The body is simple, with a shirt or top that has some detailing. There's a small shape next to this character that could be an arm or perhaps another feature.

The entire drawing has a playful, cartoon-like quality to it. The lines are loose and sketchy, giving the artwork a sense of energy and spontaneity. It's a delightful example of imaginative drawing, showcasing your child's creativity in inventing unique characters. The "Hello!" adds a friendly, interactive element to the piece. It's a drawing that invites curiosity and conversation about the characters and the story they might be part of.
