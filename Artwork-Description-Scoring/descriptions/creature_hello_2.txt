This pencil drawing is a lively and imaginative creation featuring two fantastical characters. The character on top is drawn with bubbly, exaggerated features, including large eyes and what appears to be multiple layers of wings or textured elements around its body. Its arm is raised high, waving with a greeting of "Hello!" captured in a speech bubble. The lines are brisk and expressive, suggesting movement and a cheerful demeanor.

Below this character is a second figure sharing a similar whimsical style. This character has large, round eyes and a sharp, tooth-like detail that suggests a playful or mischievous nature. Its body includes what seems like a tattered shirt or a layer of fur, enhancing its fantastical appearance. Both characters are outlined with a confident hand, and their features are accentuated with shading and dynamic strokes, bringing them vividly to life on the page. The artwork reflects a unique style and a rich imagination, likely to spark curiosity and delight in its whimsical characters.
