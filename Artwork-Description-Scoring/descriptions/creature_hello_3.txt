This piece of artwork features two imaginative and expressive characters drawn in pencil. The character at the top is larger, with a distinctive single large eye and a winged, textured head that somewhat resembles a hat. It has an extended arm raised in a waving gesture, and a word bubble above it saying "Hello!" The character's body appears to have some ribbed or striped pattern, adding an interesting texture to the drawing.

The character below is smaller, with two large, circular eyes and spiky hair. It has a somewhat similar winged or textured feature on the right side of its head and wears a detailed outfit that includes what looks like a shirt and a belt. This character's arms and hands seem more simplified and rounded, and it has a small tail with spikes at the end. 

The artwork has a whimsical and creative feel, showcasing your child's ability to design unique and expressive characters. Each figure is distinct and brought to life with detailed features and varying textures.
