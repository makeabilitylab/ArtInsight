The artwork is a drawing of two figures. The figure on the top is waving and has large, round eyes, and is wearing a striped shirt. It appears to have wings. The word "Hello" is written in cursive near the top figure. The figure on the bottom appears to be wearing a striped shirt as well, with a large, round eye, and another, smaller eye on the same side of its face. It is also waving. The figures are both drawn in a sketchy style, with a focus on the expressions of the figures. The artwork has a playful and friendly tone.  What do you think of this artwork?
