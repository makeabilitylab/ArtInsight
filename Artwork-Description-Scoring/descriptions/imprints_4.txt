Your child has created a vibrant and colorful artwork! It features many different shapes, primarily circles, in a variety of colors. There are several bright red circles, a few yellow circles, and some green circles.  There are also several brown circles, some of which are darker than others.  It looks like your child used their fingers to create the circles, which gives the artwork a unique texture. The different colors blend together in some areas, creating a beautiful effect. What do you think your child was trying to express with their artwork?  Itâ€™s amazing how they were able to use different colors and shapes to create such a dynamic piece.
