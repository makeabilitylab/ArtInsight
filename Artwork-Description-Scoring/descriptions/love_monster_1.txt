Your child has created a vibrant and expressive abstract artwork. The painting is dominated by a large, irregular shape in the center that's primarily lavender and light purple. This central form has a variety of textures and patterns within it, including small brown dashes scattered throughout, giving it a unique, textured appearance. 

The artwork features bold, contrasting colors. There's a striking red area near the center-right that stands out against the purple background. This red section includes some heart-like shapes, adding an interesting element to the composition. The purple shape is surrounded by a light blue background, with touches of pale green visible at the edges of the paper.

Black lines and shapes are used throughout the painting, creating definition and adding dynamic energy to the piece. These lines form various shapes and patterns, including what could be interpreted as simplified facial features - there's a curved line that might represent a mouth, and some marks that could be seen as eyes.

The overall effect is lively and energetic, with a mix of soft, blended areas and more defined, bold strokes. Your child has shown creativity in their use of color, shape, and line to create an engaging and expressive abstract composition. The artwork invites the viewer to explore and discover different elements within its vibrant, playful design.
