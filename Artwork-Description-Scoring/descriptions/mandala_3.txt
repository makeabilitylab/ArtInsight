This artwork is a beautifully crafted mandala with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. It is a circular design with several layers of shapes and colors all radiating from the center. The innermost part has a green star-like pattern with a central pink flower made up of petal shapes. Surrounding this is a series of sections colored in a mix of red, blue, yellow, and purple, fitting together in a stained-glass window effect. The outermost parts feature large, swirling shapes predominantly colored in pink and purple, interspersed with more leaf-like shapes in soft yellow and blue, creating a dynamic and symmetrical composition. The black outlines enhance the boldness of the colors. Your child has used coloring with noticeable care, resulting in an eye-catching and harmonious design.
