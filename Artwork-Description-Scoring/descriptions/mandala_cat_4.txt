This artwork is full of interesting details! It appears to be a  large, black, creature-like figure in the middle of the page. The creature has a large, bright pink eye on the left side of its face and an orange eye with black pupils on the right side of its face. To the left of the creature, there is a bright yellow butterfly with black veins on its wings. To the right of the creature, there are several colorful flowers. There is a blue flower in the upper right corner, two pink flowers, one yellow flower, a green flower, and a brown flower. The background of the artwork is filled with black outlines of swirls and leaves.  The artist has done a great job coloring in all the details.  Do you have any other details you want to share with me?
