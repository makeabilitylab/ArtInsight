Your child's artwork features two abstract figures created with bold, black brushstrokes on what appears to be white or light beige paper. The figures are positioned side by side, filling much of the central part of the page. 

Each figure has a round area for the face, with dots and lines suggesting eyes, noses, and mouths, giving them a slightly whimsical look. The brushstrokes are broad and varied in texture, showing some layering and potentially different pressures applied during painting. Around the figures, there are scattered black brush marks that add a sense of movement and dynamism to the composition.

The overall effect is striking due to the contrast between the dark black paint and the lighter background, which makes the figures and their features stand out prominently. This piece shows a delightful use of abstract shapes to convey characters or spirits, leaving much to the interpretation and imagination of the viewer.
