This artwork uses black paint on a light beige background. It looks like a picture of two people standing close to each other. It appears that they are facing each other, and there are many long brushstrokes throughout the artwork.  The person on the left has a frown, and there are tears falling from their eyes. It looks like the person on the right has a smile and is possibly trying to comfort the other person.  It's an interesting and powerful piece, and it shows a lot of feeling. Do you see this as well? What do you think about it?
