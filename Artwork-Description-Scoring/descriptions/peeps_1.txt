This artwork appears to be a coloring page that your child has worked on. The page is filled with a pattern of interconnected, bubble-like shapes. Most of these shapes are left uncolored, appearing as white outlines. However, several of the shapes have been filled in with various colors, creating a vibrant and playful effect.

The colored shapes include red, green, yellow, blue, orange, purple, and light green. There's a particularly interesting blue shape in the center that looks like it might be a small figure or character, possibly resembling a gingerbread man or a little person. The coloring style is free-form and expressive, with some colors extending slightly beyond the lines, which is common and charming in children's artwork.

In the top right corner of the page, there's text that reads "Express your personality," suggesting this might be part of an activity book designed to encourage creativity and self-expression. The overall effect is cheerful and engaging, with the colored shapes standing out boldly against the uncolored background. Your child has made some interesting color choices, creating a lively and eye-catching piece of art.
