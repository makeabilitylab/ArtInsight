This is a beautiful artwork! It looks like your child painted a flower against a blue sky. The flower is large and has a purple and pink center. The center of the flower is yellow with brown spots inside.  A green stem sprouts from the base of the flower, and there's a bright green band at the bottom of the artwork, which might be grass. At the top of the picture, a yellow sun is shining down on the flower. The sun is a little bit abstract, it looks like a burst of yellow light with some green accents. It's a very cheerful and bright artwork! I hope your child is proud of their creation. Does the artwork remind you of anything, or is there anything else you'd like to share about it?
