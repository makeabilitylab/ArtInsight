This artwork is a delightful mix of drawing and crafting. The main focus is a rectangular shape in the center, outlined in red and filled with orange crayon scribbles. Inside this shape are several colorful pom-poms of different sizes and colors, including red, pink, orange, blue, and green. There's also a green pipe cleaner or fuzzy stick curved across the pom-poms, adding an interesting texture and shape.

Surrounding this central element are many heart shapes drawn in red. These hearts form a border around the entire page, with larger hearts at the top and bottom, and smaller ones along the sides. The hearts are simple outlines, giving the artwork a sweet, playful feel.

At the bottom right of the page, there appears to be some text written in red, which looks like "Na na". This could be a signature or a title for the piece.

The overall composition is vibrant and tactile, combining flat drawings with three-dimensional elements. The color scheme is predominantly red and orange, with pops of other colors from the pom-poms. It's a very engaging piece that invites touch as well as visual exploration. Your child has created a wonderful mix of textures and shapes that's sure to be fun to explore!
