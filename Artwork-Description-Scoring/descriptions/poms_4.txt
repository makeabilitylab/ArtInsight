This artwork is a wonderful mix of colors and textures!  It appears to be a basket full of colorful pom-poms. The basket is made of a green pipe cleaner that curves around the pom-poms.  The pom-poms are a variety of colors, including red, pink, orange, and blue.  Some of the pom-poms have glitter on them.  The background of the artwork is orange and is filled with horizontal lines. Around the basket, there are red hearts of different sizes, and the word 'nana' is written at the bottom of the artwork.  It seems like your child put a lot of effort into this piece, and it is beautiful!  What do you think about it?
