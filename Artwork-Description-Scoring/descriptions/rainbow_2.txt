This vibrant piece of artwork features a colorful drawing largely dominated by a large rainbow arcing across the page. The rainbow consists of multiple evenly spaced arches starting from the left side of the page, each line drawn in a distinct color—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. On the right side of the sheet, there is a bright yellow sun with rays extending outward; it seems to be peering out from the top edge, just above the rainbow. At the bottom of the page, there is a broad strip of green, possibly representing grass or ground. Interestingly, toward the right bottom corner, there's a black pot with a vivid yellow band around the rim, which could be referencing the classic tale of a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. The sky above everything is perhaps indicated by a thin strip of blue drawn along the top edge of the paper.

The use of bold, primary and secondary colors makes this artwork eye-catching and expressive. It’s a cheerful scene that combines elements of nature with imaginative storytelling, portrayed through a child's eyes.
