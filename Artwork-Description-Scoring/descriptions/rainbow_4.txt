This is a very colorful and fun artwork!  There is a large rainbow arching over a green field.  The rainbow has seven distinct colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and pink.  There's a bright yellow sun in the upper right corner, with yellow rays coming out of it. The bottom of the artwork is a green field. At the bottom right of the image is a black pot with a rim of yellow dots, which is a great detail!  It looks like a fun and colorful day in the artwork.  What do you think it represents to your child?
