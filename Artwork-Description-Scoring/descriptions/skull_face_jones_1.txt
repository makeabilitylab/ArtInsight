This artwork is a pencil sketch on a light-colored paper, which appears to be resting on a textured, reddish-brown surface. The sketch contains several elements, primarily focused on character designs. In the upper left and right corners, there are two head sketches, both showing figures with tousled hair and intense expressions. The figure on the left appears to be looking to the side with a stern expression, while the one on the right seems to be facing forward with a more troubled look.

In the center-left of the paper, there's a full-body sketch of a character. This figure is wearing what looks like a jacket or coat, pants, and boots. They're holding what appears to be a long, curved object, possibly a weapon or tool. The character's hair is messy and their face has some interesting details, though it's a bit hard to make out clearly in this sketch.

To the right of the full-body figure, there are some text elements. The words "FACE JONES" are written vertically, with "FACE" above "JONES". Below this, there are a few more sketched elements that look like they could be logos or symbols.

The overall style of the drawing is loose and sketchy, with confident, expressive lines. It gives the impression of a character design process or concept art, possibly for a comic or animated character. The artwork shows a good grasp of proportions and facial expressions, even in this rough sketch form.
