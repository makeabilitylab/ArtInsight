This artwork features three character sketches arranged vertically on a single sheet of paper, each displaying a distinct style and character design, primarily drawn in pencil. At the top, there are two face sketches positioned side by side; the character on the left has fuller hair, soft facial lines, and a visible ear, while the character on the right has spikier hair, pronounced sharp eyes, and angular face details indicative of a more intense expression.

Below these faces, there's a full-body sketch of a character who appears to be wearing a detailed suit that might suggest a futuristic or armored theme, indicated by the segmented pieces and boots. The character has a helmet or a head covering with distinct goggles and a facial mask that covers the lower half of their face, giving a mysterious aura. In their right hand, they hold an object that resembles a sword or blade.

On the right side of the page, below the face sketches, are stylized letters that spell "SYN KILL" and "FACE JONES‚Äù. These could be potential names or titles associated with the characters or the theme of the artwork.

Overall, the drawing showcases creativity and an interest in character design, possibly inspired by video game or comic book aesthetics. The layout and the inclusion of names suggest a narrative or conceptual framing made by the young artist.
