This is a really cool drawing! It features three different versions of the same person, all drawn in pencil. The person on the left is facing to the side and has a short haircut. You can see a patch on their cheek and a bandage on their forehead. Above the person is an image of a person facing forward. This person is also wearing a bandana and has a serious expression on their face. The third version of the person is a full-body image of them standing with their hands on their hips. This person is wearing a mask that looks like a skull. The person is also holding a weapon that looks like a hockey stick. Below this image is the name "Face Jones" written vertically. It looks like you have a very creative artist in your family! Is there anything else you'd like to know about the drawing?
