This vibrant artwork features a large, orange sunflower taking prominence in the upper part of the piece, really drawing the eye with its bright, warm colors. Its petals are generously filled in with orange crayon, featuring shades that give them a twirling illusion, adding a dynamic feel. The center of the flower is colored in with crimson, and some textural strokes hint at the seeds typically found in a sunflower's heart.

The background contrasts starkly with the sunflower, using expanses of cool, dark blue paint. The painting technique varies across the background, creating a lively mixture of textures and intensities ranging from light to deep blue. This dramatic use of color highlights the sunflower, making it appear almost luminous against the dark backdrop.

The artwork has an expressive, spontaneous quality to it, suggesting movement and freedom within the strokes both in the petals and the flowing background. This could evoke a feeling of the sunflower standing resilient and bright against a turbulent sky. Such a depiction might reflect a sense of optimism or resilience, symbolizing brightness and hope prevailing over darkness.
