What a lovely piece of artwork! This creation features the upper right corner of a sunflower, which takes up most of the upper left side of the page. The sunflower's petals are rendered in bright yellow with touches of orange shading, and outlined in a fine, dark line. The center of the sunflower is textured in a rich reddish-brown.

The background is predominantly blue, with various shades and brush strokes that create a dynamic and somewhat swirling pattern. The vigorous brushstrokes give the scene energy and complement the warmth of the sunflower petals nicely.

The use of contrast between the vivid yellow sunflower and the calming blue background creates a striking and beautiful effect. Overall, your child has done an amazing job combining color and form to create this vibrant and cheerful artwork!
