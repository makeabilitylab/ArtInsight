This is a beautiful piece of art! It looks like a large sunflower with yellow petals and a brown center. The sunflower is at the top of the picture, with a bright blue background beneath it. It looks like the artist used a combination of yellow, orange, and brown to create the sunflower, and then used blue and white to create the background. The blue background is a very bright color, while the sunflower's yellow petals are lighter and softer. The blue and yellow colors look very nice together, and make for a bright and cheerful picture! I hope your child had fun creating this artwork!
