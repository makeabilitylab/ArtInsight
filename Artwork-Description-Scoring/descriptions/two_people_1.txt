Your child has created a vibrant and expressive artwork featuring two cartoon-style figures. The drawing is placed on a white paper that's sitting on what appears to be a purple cutting mat with measurement markings. The figures are drawn with bold, energetic lines using various colors.

On the left side of the paper is a figure with large, round eyes and a small mouth. This character is wearing what looks like a yellow shirt or jacket with blue accents. The face is colored in shades of brown and tan, with messy hair drawn on top of the head.

To the right is another figure with a big smile and round eyes. This character has spiky black hair sticking up on top. The face is colored in pinkish-orange tones with some cross-hatching. There's a hint of blue near the top of the head, possibly representing a headband or hair accessory. This figure seems to be wearing something with a touch of purple at the bottom.

Both characters have a lively, animated quality to them. The lines are loose and free, suggesting your child was very expressive in their drawing style. The use of multiple colors adds depth and personality to each figure. The overall impression is one of fun and creativity, with each character having its own distinct look and feel.
