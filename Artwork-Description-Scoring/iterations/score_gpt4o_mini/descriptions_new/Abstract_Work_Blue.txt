The artwork features a predominantly blue background, created with broad, sweeping brush strokes that give a sense of movement and texture. The blue tones vary in intensity, with darker shades interspersed among lighter ones, creating depth within the blue area.

In the center, there is a mix of green and brown colors. The green appears in various shades, with some areas being darker and more opaque, while others are lighter and more translucent. The brown is used in a smaller area, adding contrast to the greens and blues.

The overall shape of the composition resembles an oval or an abstract figure, with the blue forming the outer area and the greens and browns concentrated in the middle. There are also some areas where the paint has been applied more thickly, resulting in a textured appearance.

In the upper left corner, the name "<redacted>" is written in a light color, possibly pencil or a lighter paint, indicating the artist's identity. The paper itself appears to be a standard white, providing a stark contrast to the vibrant colors used in the artwork.

Overall, the piece showcases a dynamic interplay of colors and textures, highlighting the child's creative expression.
