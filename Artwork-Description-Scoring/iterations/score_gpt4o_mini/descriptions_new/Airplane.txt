The artwork depicts an airplane, drawn with a combination of colors and shapes. The airplane is oriented to the right, with its wings extended upward. 

The body of the airplane is primarily colored in light gray, with darker gray shading along the sides, giving it a three-dimensional appearance. The cockpit is represented at the front with a blue-tinted window, and there are several small rectangular windows along the side of the fuselage, drawn in a light blue color.

A yellow stripe runs horizontally along the lower part of the airplane's body, just above a blue stripe that curves slightly. The wings are drawn in a slightly darker gray, with hints of blue and yellow at the tips, suggesting a design detail.

The landing gear is depicted with two circular shapes at the bottom, colored in black with red accents, indicating the wheels. The overall composition is dynamic, with the airplane appearing as if it is in flight, captured in a simple yet effective manner. The background is left blank, emphasizing the airplane as the central focus of the artwork.
