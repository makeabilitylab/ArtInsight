The artwork features two characters embracing, likely inspired by popular animated figures. The character on the left has long, flowing blonde hair, which is colored in bright yellow with some light shading. Their face is depicted with a gentle expression, featuring large, expressive eyes colored in green and blue. The character wears a dress that is predominantly blue with intricate designs, including purple and pink elements, and there are small circular shapes that appear to represent embellishments.

The character on the right has vibrant red hair styled in loose waves, colored in shades of orange and red. Their face shows a warm smile, with closed eyes and a few freckles across the cheeks. This character is dressed in a purple garment, which has a large collar and appears to be wrapped around the other character. The overall composition emphasizes the closeness and affection between the two figures, with their arms wrapped around each other.

The background is minimal, allowing the focus to remain on the characters. The colors used are bright and vivid, enhancing the joyful theme of the artwork. The paper has a smooth texture, and the coloring appears to be done with crayons or colored pencils, providing a slightly textured look to the filled areas. The edges of the artwork are cut in a way that suggests a playful, informal presentation.
