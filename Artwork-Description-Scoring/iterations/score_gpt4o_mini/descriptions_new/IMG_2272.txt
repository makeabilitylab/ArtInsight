The artwork features a prominent handprint in the center, created with a combination of colors. The handprint is outlined in black, with the palm filled in with a bright yellow hue. The fingers are depicted in a mix of gray and black, with some areas showing lighter shades.

Surrounding the handprint, there are various colorful marks and strokes. To the left and right of the handprint, there are red and pink lines, while a green line arcs above the hand. The background appears to be a light cream or off-white color, with some crumpling visible, suggesting the paper has been handled.

At the bottom of the artwork, there are letters and numbers written in a purple color that reads "HBD" followed by the number "4." The overall composition is playful and vibrant, emphasizing the handprint as the focal point.
