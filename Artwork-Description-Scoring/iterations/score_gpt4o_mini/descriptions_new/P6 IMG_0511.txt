The artwork features a drawing of a duck, predominantly colored in yellow. The duck is positioned horizontally across the page, facing to the left. 

The body of the duck is outlined in black, with a smooth, rounded shape. The yellow coloring is applied with a crayon or colored pencil, creating a textured appearance. The duck's head is slightly larger in proportion to its body, and it has a prominent orange beak, which is drawn in a triangular shape. 

The eye of the duck is large and circular, filled in with black, and there is a small white circle within it, suggesting a reflection. Above the eye, there are a few short, curved lines in yellow, indicating feathers.

The background is a light blue, suggesting a sky, with some lighter blue and white areas that may represent clouds. At the bottom of the page, there is a horizontal band of purple, which could represent water or ground. 

Overall, the composition is simple yet effective, showcasing the child's creativity and use of color. The lines are bold and confident, contributing to the overall playful nature of the artwork.
