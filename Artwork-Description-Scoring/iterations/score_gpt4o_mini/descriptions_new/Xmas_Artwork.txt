The artwork features a playful scene with a Christmas theme. On the left side, there is a green Christmas tree, which has a triangular shape with a wide base tapering to a point at the top. The tree is decorated with colorful ornaments represented by small circles in red, blue, and yellow. At the top of the tree, there is a yellow star.

Next to the tree, there is a character that appears to be a festive figure. This figure has a round yellow face with large, expressive eyes and a wide smile. It is wearing a red outfit with a white trim, and a red and white hat with a pom-pom at the tip. The figure has stick-like arms raised in a cheerful pose, with black lines representing the arms and legs.

On the right side of the artwork, there is a cut-out shape that resembles a reindeer or a similar animal. This figure has a purple body with black outlines and features. It has a white face with two black dots for eyes and a simple line for a mouth. The animal has antlers drawn in black, and its legs are depicted with vertical black lines. The background behind the animal is mostly white, with some purple lines adding texture.

The overall composition is lively and colorful, with a wavy green line at the bottom that adds a decorative element to the scene. The use of bright colors and simple shapes contributes to a cheerful and festive atmosphere in the artwork.
