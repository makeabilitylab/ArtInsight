The artwork features a combination of a human figure and an animal, specifically a deer. The central figure is depicted standing upright, with the upper body resembling a human, including arms crossed over the chest and a head with short, wavy hair. The figure has antlers on top of the head, indicating its connection to the deer.

The lower half of the figure transitions into the body of a deer, which is drawn with a smooth outline. The deerâ€™s legs are visible, and it stands on a flat surface. 

Surrounding the central figure are several smaller, cartoonish cat-like creatures. These creatures have large, round heads with prominent eyes and small, triangular ears. They appear to be sitting or lying down, with their bodies drawn in a simplistic style, featuring curved lines and minimal detail.

The background consists of lined paper, which provides a structured grid that contrasts with the playful nature of the drawings. The overall composition combines elements of fantasy and whimsy, showcasing a creative blend of human and animal characteristics.
