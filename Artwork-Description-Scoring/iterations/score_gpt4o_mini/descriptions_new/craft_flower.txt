The artwork features a flower design created on a large sheet of pink paper. At the top of the composition is a circular paper plate, which serves as the flower's bloom. The plate is decorated with a variety of colors, including deep red, purple, black, and blue, applied in a splattered and brushstroke style. The colors are dispersed throughout the surface, with some areas densely packed and others more sparse, creating a dynamic visual effect.

Beneath the plate, the flower's stem is represented by a series of green tissue paper squares and rectangles. These pieces are arranged vertically, forming a stem that connects the bloom to the base of the artwork. The green tissue paper has a slightly crinkled texture, adding dimension to the stem. 

The background is a smooth pink paper, which contrasts with the colors of the flower and enhances its visibility. The overall layout is simple yet effective, with the flower's bloom prominently displayed at the top and the stem extending downward, creating a clear focal point. The combination of materials and colors showcases the child's creativity and artistic expression.
