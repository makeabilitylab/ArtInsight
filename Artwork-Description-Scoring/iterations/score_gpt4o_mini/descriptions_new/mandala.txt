The artwork is a circular design, resembling a mandala, with a vibrant and symmetrical composition. The outer edge of the circle is outlined in black, providing a distinct border. 

Inside the circle, the design features a series of intricate shapes and patterns. The background is divided into sections filled with various colors. The predominant colors include bright pink, red, green, and soft pastel shades. 

At the center, there is a green area shaped like a star or flower, surrounded by a symmetrical arrangement of petals or leaf-like shapes. These shapes alternate in color, with some being white, light pink, and pale blue. The outer sections contain swirling, flowing lines in shades of pink and red, adding a dynamic quality to the design.

The overall effect is one of harmony and balance, with the colors and shapes working together to create a visually engaging piece. The use of bold colors and clear outlines enhances the clarity of the design, making it stand out. The artwork is being held up, showing its circular form against a neutral background, which allows the colors to be the focal point.
