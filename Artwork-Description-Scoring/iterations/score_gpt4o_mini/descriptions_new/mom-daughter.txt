The artwork features a vibrant and colorful scene. At the center, there are two figures depicted with simple shapes. Each figure has a round head, represented by a circle, and elongated bodies made of straight lines. The heads are colored in blue, with large circular eyes that are also blue, and they have pink outlines.

Above the figures, there is a large, swirling cloud drawn in dark blue, which occupies a significant portion of the upper part of the artwork. To the right of the cloud, a bright yellow sun is illustrated with straight rays extending outward, creating a sunny atmosphere.

On the left side of the scene, there is a flower with a round orange center and green leaves. The flower is outlined in green, and the petals are colored in a bright pink. 

The background is a light green, and there are decorative elements at the bottom, including a zigzag pattern in a lighter green, adding texture to the composition. The overall layout is cheerful and playful, showcasing the child's creativity through bold colors and simple forms.
