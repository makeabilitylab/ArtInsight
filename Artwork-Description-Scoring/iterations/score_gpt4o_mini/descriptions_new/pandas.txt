The artwork features a composition created primarily with black paint on a light-colored background, likely paper. The overall layout includes two central figures that appear to be stylized faces, positioned side by side.

Each face is represented with simple shapes: the left figure has a rounded head with two oval shapes for eyes and a small curved line for a mouth, while the right figure has a similar structure, with slightly different eye shapes and a similar mouth line. The faces are surrounded by broad, sweeping brush strokes that create a textured effect, resembling hair or abstract shapes that frame the figures.

The brush strokes vary in thickness and direction, adding depth and movement to the piece. The background is mostly clear, allowing the black elements to stand out prominently. The use of black paint creates a strong contrast against the lighter background, emphasizing the figures and their features.

Overall, the artwork showcases a playful and expressive style, with a focus on bold shapes and lines. The simplicity of the forms invites a sense of creativity and imagination.
