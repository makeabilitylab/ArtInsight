The artwork features a grid of cartoon-like bunny shapes, reminiscent of marshmallow peeps. The background consists of a repeating pattern of these bunny figures, each outlined in black. 

The bunnies are colored in various shades, creating a vibrant and playful composition. The colors include:

- **Red**: Several bunnies are filled with a red hue, primarily located in the upper left and center sections.
- **Pink**: A few bunnies are colored in a lighter pink, adjacent to the red ones.
- **Yellow**: A yellow bunny is positioned towards the center-right area.
- **Green**: There are green bunnies scattered throughout, particularly in the lower sections.
- **Blue**: A prominent blue bunny is centrally located, standing out among the others.
- **Purple**: A purple bunny is situated towards the bottom right.

The overall layout is symmetrical, with the bunnies arranged in a grid-like formation. The phrase "EXPRESS YOUR Peepsonality" is printed in a playful font at the top right corner, adding to the theme of the artwork. The use of bright colors and the repetitive bunny shapes contribute to a cheerful and engaging visual effect. The paper has a slight texture, typical of coloring book pages.
