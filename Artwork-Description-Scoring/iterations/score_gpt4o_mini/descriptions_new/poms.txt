The artwork features a central three-dimensional arrangement created with colorful pom-poms and a pipe cleaner, set against a flat background. 

**Overall Composition:**
The background is a white sheet of paper with a prominent rectangular area filled with orange and red crayon strokes, suggesting a textured surface. Surrounding this area are multiple red heart shapes drawn with crayon, arranged in a loose pattern along the edges of the paper.

**Main Elements:**
In the center, there is a small red cup filled with pom-poms in various colors: red, pink, green, and blue. The pom-poms are round and fluffy, adding a tactile dimension to the piece. A green pipe cleaner is positioned across the top of the cup, resembling a handle or a decorative element.

**Supporting Details:**
The hearts are outlined in red and vary in size, with some appearing more filled in than others. Below the central arrangement, there is a handwritten text that reads "na na," drawn in a darker crayon, which adds a personal touch to the artwork.

**Texture and Color:**
The background has a mix of smooth and textured areas due to the crayon application, while the pom-poms provide a soft, rounded texture. The colors used are vibrant, contributing to a lively and cheerful appearance.
