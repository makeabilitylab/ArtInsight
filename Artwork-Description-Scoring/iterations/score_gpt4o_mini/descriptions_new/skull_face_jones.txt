The artwork features a sheet of paper with several pencil sketches arranged in a vertical layout. The background of the paper is slightly wrinkled, indicating it may have been handled or crumpled.

At the top of the page, there are two smaller head sketches positioned side by side. The first head is turned slightly to the left, showcasing a character with short, textured hair and a facial expression that includes a visible scar on the cheek. The second head is facing forward, with a more neutral expression and slightly longer hair that appears tousled.

Below these head sketches is a larger full-body drawing of a character. This figure stands upright, holding a curved weapon in the right hand. The character has a distinctive helmet that covers the entire head, with a design that suggests a mask-like appearance. The body is dressed in a long-sleeved shirt and pants, with additional details such as straps or armor-like elements on the arms and legs. The feet are shown wearing boots, and the stance is confident.

To the right of the full-body character, there is text that reads "SKULL JONES," with "SKULL" positioned above "JONES." The letters are stylized, with some angular features, and the text appears to be integrated into the design, possibly as part of the character's name or title.

Overall, the artwork combines character design with textual elements, showcasing creativity and attention to detail in the depiction of the figures and the stylization of the text.
