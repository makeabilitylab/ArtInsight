The artwork features a prominent sunflower positioned in the upper left corner of the composition. The sunflower's petals are depicted in a bright yellow hue, radiating outward with a slightly curved shape. Each petal has a defined outline, created with a darker orange or reddish color, adding depth and detail. The center of the sunflower is a rich brown, textured to suggest a round, seed-filled core.

The background consists of a deep blue wash that occupies the majority of the space. The blue is applied in varying shades, with some areas appearing lighter and others darker, creating a sense of movement or texture. Brush strokes are visible, suggesting a dynamic application of paint. 

The paper has a yellow border, framing the artwork and enhancing the overall presentation. The combination of the bright sunflower against the blue background creates a striking contrast, drawing attention to the floral element. The artwork showcases a blend of colors and textures, highlighting the child's creative expression.
