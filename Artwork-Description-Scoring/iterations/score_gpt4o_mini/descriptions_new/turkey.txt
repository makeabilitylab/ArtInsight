The artwork features a cartoon-style turkey at its center, outlined prominently in black. The turkey's body is a large, circular shape filled with a warm brown color, while its head is slightly smaller and also brown. Two large, round eyes are positioned on the head, each filled with a solid black circle for the pupils, creating a playful expression. 

From the turkey's beak, which is a triangular shape, a red wattle hangs down, depicted with a smooth, bright red color. The background consists of colorful feathers that fan out from the turkey's body, each feather rendered in various pastel shades. The feathers include light green, pink, and blue, with some areas showing a blend of colors, creating a watercolor effect. 

The background is dotted with small black circles, adding texture and contrast to the overall composition. The artwork is framed with a thick black border that enhances the vibrant colors within. Curved lines and swirls are incorporated around the turkey, adding a whimsical touch to the piece. The paper appears to have a smooth texture, and the colors are applied in a way that suggests a playful and creative approach to the subject.
