The artwork features two figures drawn on a white sheet of paper. The figures are positioned side by side, with the left figure appearing slightly larger than the right.

The left figure has a round face with a light brown skin tone. The hair is depicted in dark brown with some lighter brown highlights, styled in a short, slightly tousled manner. The eyes are large and circular, filled with black and white, giving them a prominent appearance. The eyebrows are drawn in a darker shade, arching above the eyes. The mouth is a simple curved line, suggesting a neutral expression. The figure is wearing a blue and yellow outfit, with the blue being the dominant color on the upper part and yellow on the lower part. A brown backpack is visible on the figure's back, outlined in darker brown.

The right figure has a round face with a peach skin tone. The hair is illustrated in black, with a spiky style that extends upwards. The eyes are also large and circular, filled with black and white, similar to the left figure. The mouth is drawn as a wide smile, with a light orange color used for the lips. This figure has a blue headband across the forehead and is adorned with colorful accessories, including a necklace with a yellow pendant. The figure's outfit includes a purple top, and there are long, flowing lines in purple and red that suggest hair or additional accessories.

The background is plain white, allowing the colorful figures to stand out prominently. The overall composition is lively and expressive, showcasing the child's creativity through the use of bold colors and distinct features.
