The artwork features a large, stylized Christmas tree, prominently displayed in the center of the page. The tree is depicted in a triangular shape, with a textured appearance created by the use of brown and green crayon or marker. The tree is adorned with various circular ornaments, primarily in blue and green, which are scattered across its surface. 

At the top of the tree, there is a decorative element resembling a star or a bow, drawn in yellow and outlined in black. The tree's base is wider, tapering towards the top, and it has a jagged edge, suggesting branches.

Below the tree, there are several presents illustrated in vibrant colors. The gifts are rectangular and square in shape, with some wrapped in red and green, featuring bows on top. The presents are positioned on either side of the tree, with a few overlapping.

In the foreground, there is a blue area that appears to represent a surface, possibly a floor or ground. The background is left mostly blank, allowing the tree and presents to stand out prominently. The overall composition is colorful and festive, capturing a joyful holiday theme.
