This artwork is created on a white sheet of paper, oriented vertically. The primary focus of the piece is a large, irregularly shaped area of blue paint that occupies much of the central portion of the paper. The blue paint is applied with broad, sweeping brushstrokes, creating a textured appearance with visible brush marks. The blue area has a roughly oval shape, with the paint extending towards the edges of the paper in some places.

Within the blue area, there are additional colors and shapes. Near the top right section of the blue area, there is a patch of green paint, which transitions into a smaller area of brown paint. This brown paint has a slightly textured appearance, with some areas appearing thicker than others. Below this, there is a thin vertical line of green paint that extends downward.

Towards the bottom of the blue area, there is a significant amount of dark green paint. This dark green paint is applied in a more concentrated manner, creating a dense, almost solid appearance. The dark green paint has some areas where it blends with the blue, creating a mix of the two colors.

In the lower part of the artwork, there are some additional details. On the left side, there are some lighter green brushstrokes that extend outward from the main blue area. These brushstrokes are more loosely applied, with some areas of the white paper still visible beneath them. Near the bottom center, there is a small, elongated patch of brown paint.

The overall composition of the artwork is dynamic, with a variety of colors and textures creating a visually engaging piece. The child's name, "<redacted>," is written in light gray pencil in the top left corner of the paper.
