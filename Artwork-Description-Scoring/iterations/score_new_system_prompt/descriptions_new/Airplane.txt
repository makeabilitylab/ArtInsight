This artwork features a drawing of an airplane, depicted in a side view. The airplane is primarily outlined in black, with additional colors used to highlight various parts.

The body of the airplane is drawn with a light gray color, and it has a streamlined shape. The nose of the airplane is rounded, and the tail tapers to a point. The airplane has two wings extending outwards, with the left wing drawn larger and more prominently due to the side perspective.

The cockpit windows are colored in blue, with three rectangular windows visible at the front of the airplane. Along the side of the airplane, there are a series of small, square windows, also colored in blue. There are eight windows in total, evenly spaced along the fuselage.

Below the windows, there is a horizontal yellow stripe that runs along the length of the airplane, starting from the nose and extending to the tail. Below this yellow stripe, there is a blue stripe that follows the same path.

The airplane has two engines, one visible under each wing. The engines are circular and colored in black with red accents. The landing gear is not visible, suggesting the airplane is in flight.

The tail of the airplane features a vertical stabilizer and two horizontal stabilizers. The vertical stabilizer has a yellow stripe at the top and a blue stripe below it.

The background of the artwork is plain white, with no additional elements or scenery.

Overall, the drawing is detailed and uses a combination of colors to highlight different parts of the airplane, creating a clear and recognizable depiction of an aircraft.
