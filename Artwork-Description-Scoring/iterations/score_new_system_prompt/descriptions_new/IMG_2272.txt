This artwork features a handprint prominently in the center of the paper. The handprint is outlined in black paint, with the interior of the hand filled with yellow paint. The fingers and thumb are clearly defined, and the black outline is bold and slightly uneven, giving a textured appearance.

To the left of the handprint, there are red and pink brushstrokes, some of which are curved and others are straight. On the right side, there are green and red vertical lines, with some red marks extending outward from the handprint.

Below the handprint, there are letters painted in red and purple. The letters "HBD" are clearly visible in purple, while the letters "I" and "L" are painted in red. The letters appear to be written in a freehand style, with some variation in size and thickness.

The background of the paper is white, and the paper itself has some visible creases and wrinkles, adding texture to the overall appearance. The paint application varies in thickness, with some areas appearing more saturated and others lighter, creating a dynamic and colorful composition.

Overall, the artwork is vibrant and expressive, showcasing a mix of bold outlines, bright colors, and freeform brushstrokes.
