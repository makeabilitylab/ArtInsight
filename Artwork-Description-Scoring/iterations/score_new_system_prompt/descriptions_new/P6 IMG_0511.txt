This artwork features a large, yellow bird-like figure drawn on a light blue background. The bird occupies most of the space on the paper, with its body oriented horizontally and facing to the left.

The bird's body is filled with yellow coloring, applied with visible crayon strokes. The outline of the bird is drawn with a thick black line, giving it a defined shape. The bird has a large, round eye near the top left of the image, which is filled in with black, leaving a small white spot to suggest a highlight.

The beak is prominently drawn in orange and is positioned to the left of the eye. The beak is large and rounded, with a few black lines indicating details. The bird's wing is outlined in black and filled with yellow, located towards the center of the body. The wing has a simple, rounded shape.

The tail is positioned on the right side of the bird and is drawn with a few jagged lines, giving it a slightly spiky appearance. Below the bird, there is a patch of purple coloring, which appears to be scribbled in with crayon, suggesting a ground or surface on which the bird is standing or lying.

The background is light blue, with some areas showing variations in shading, possibly indicating a sky or open space. The edges of the paper are slightly curled, and there are a few small tears or rough spots along the top edge.

Overall, the artwork is vibrant and features a clear, central subject with bold outlines and bright colors. The use of different colors and the detailed drawing of the bird's features demonstrate a thoughtful and creative approach.
