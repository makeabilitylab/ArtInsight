This artwork features a colorful fish drawn on a black background, with various foam rectangles glued around it. 

The fish is centrally located and is outlined in black. Its body is divided into several sections, each filled with different colors and patterns. The head of the fish is colored in green with a red area near the mouth and black vertical lines. The eye is a black circle with a red outline. The body of the fish has a combination of blue, purple, and green sections with black vertical stripes. The fins and tail are yellow with black horizontal lines, and the top fin also has blue sections.

Surrounding the fish are numerous foam rectangles in various colors, including yellow, blue, orange, and red. These rectangles are scattered across the black background, creating a vibrant and dynamic composition. The foam pieces are of different sizes but are mostly rectangular in shape.

The black background contrasts sharply with the bright colors of the fish and the foam rectangles, making the colors stand out vividly. The overall effect is lively and engaging, with a strong emphasis on bright, contrasting colors and geometric shapes.
