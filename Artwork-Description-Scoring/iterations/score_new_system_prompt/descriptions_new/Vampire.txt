This artwork is created on a piece of orange paper and features a large central figure that occupies most of the space. The figure has a round head with blue hair that extends to the sides, and a small red and white object on top of the head, possibly resembling a hat or a bow.

The body of the figure is expansive and filled with a variety of patterns and shapes. The body starts from the neck and spreads out widely, resembling a flowing garment or cape. This garment is divided into sections, each containing different patterns and shapes. Some of the patterns include:

- Black diamonds
- Red hearts

The background is entirely orange, providing a strong contrast to the colorful figure in the center. The artwork is characterized by its bold use of color and the intricate detailing within the figure's garment.
