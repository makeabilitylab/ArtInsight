The artwork is created on a dark blue background. The central focus is a swirling pattern made with white paint, which appears to be applied with a combination of brush strokes and finger painting. The white paint forms a circular, cloud-like shape that occupies most of the central area of the artwork, with some parts extending towards the edges.

Within this white swirling pattern, slightly off-center to the right, there is a cut-out figure of a person. The figure is colored in red and has a pointed hood, suggesting a cloak or robe. The figure is outlined in white, making it stand out against the darker background and the white paint swirls.

The white paint has a textured appearance, with visible brush strokes and areas where the paint is thicker, creating a sense of depth and movement. There are also some smaller white spots and smudges scattered around the main swirl, adding to the dynamic feel of the composition.

Overall, the artwork combines the contrasting colors of dark blue, white, and red, with a mix of smooth and textured elements, creating a visually engaging piece.
