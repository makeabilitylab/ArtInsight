The artwork depicts a detailed and realistic portrait of a bulldog, created using a scratchboard technique on a black background. The bulldog's face is the central focus, occupying most of the space in the composition.

The bulldog's fur is rendered with intricate, fine lines that vary in density to create texture and depth. The fur on the top of the head and around the ears is depicted with short, curved lines, while the fur on the cheeks and neck is illustrated with longer, more flowing lines. The contrast between the white lines and the black background effectively highlights the contours and features of the bulldog's face.

The bulldog's eyes are prominent and expressive, with detailed shading that gives them a lifelike appearance. The pupils are dark, surrounded by lighter areas that suggest reflections, adding to the realism. The nose is large and central, with a textured surface created by dense, short lines. The nostrils are dark and well-defined.

The mouth is slightly open, revealing the bulldog's teeth and tongue. The teeth are depicted with precise, small lines, and the tongue has a textured appearance, contributing to the overall realism of the portrait. The lower part of the face, including the jowls and chin, is rendered with a combination of short and long lines, creating a sense of volume and form.

The ears are positioned symmetrically on either side of the head, with the left ear (on the right side of the image) showing a slight fold. The background is entirely black, which contrasts sharply with the white lines of the bulldog, making the figure stand out prominently.

Overall, the artwork showcases a high level of detail and skill in the scratchboard technique, capturing the distinctive features and textures of the bulldog with precision and care.
