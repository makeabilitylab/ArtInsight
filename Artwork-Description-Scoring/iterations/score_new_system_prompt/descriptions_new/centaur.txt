The artwork is drawn on lined paper, with horizontal blue lines evenly spaced across the page. The primary figure in the drawing is a centaur-like character, combining human and animal features. 

The upper part of the figure is human, with a head, arms, and torso. The head has short, wavy hair and two antler-like protrusions extending upward. The facial features include two eyes, a small nose, and a mouth. The arms are crossed over the chest, giving a sense of a confident or relaxed posture.

The lower part of the figure resembles the body of a four-legged animal, similar to a deer or horse. The body is drawn with a smooth, continuous line, and the legs are slender and end in hooves. The tail is short and slightly curved.

Below and around the main figure, there are several smaller drawings of cat-like faces. These faces have large, expressive eyes, small triangular ears, and whiskers. Some of the faces are partially obscured by the centaur figure's legs.

The drawing is done entirely in pencil, with no additional colors or shading. The lines are clear and distinct, and the overall composition is centered on the page, with the main figure standing upright and the smaller faces arranged around its legs.
