This artwork is composed of a paper plate and colored tissue paper arranged on a pink background. The paper plate is positioned at the top center of the artwork and is decorated with various colors of paint. The paint on the plate includes splashes and strokes of red, blue, purple, and black. The paint is applied in a somewhat random pattern, with some areas showing more concentrated color and others more sparse.

The paper plate is attached to a pink sheet of paper, which serves as the background. Below the plate, there are pieces of green tissue paper arranged to form a vertical line that extends downward from the plate. The green tissue paper pieces are irregularly shaped and overlap each other, creating a textured appearance. The tissue paper extends from the bottom edge of the plate to the lower part of the pink background.

The overall composition suggests a combination of painting and collage techniques, with the colorful plate and green tissue paper creating a visually engaging piece. The use of different materials and colors adds variety and interest to the artwork.
