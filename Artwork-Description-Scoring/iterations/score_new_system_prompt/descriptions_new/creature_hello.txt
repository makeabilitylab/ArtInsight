This artwork features two distinct characters drawn in pencil on a piece of paper. The characters are positioned vertically, one above the other.

The top character has a large, single eye with a prominent pupil and a small circular highlight, giving it a shiny appearance. The character's head is adorned with what appears to be a hat or helmet, and it has a wide, open mouth with a visible tongue. The character's right arm is raised, with the hand open and fingers spread, as if waving. The left arm is extended downward. The character has a body with horizontal lines, possibly indicating a ribbed texture or clothing. There are also wing-like shapes extending from the sides of the body. To the right of this character, the word "Hello!" is written in a playful, handwritten style.

The bottom character has two large, round eyes with small pupils and a similar shiny highlight. The head is surrounded by jagged lines, possibly representing hair or a mane. This character has a wide, open mouth with a visible tongue and sharp teeth. The body is rectangular with a round collar and horizontal lines, suggesting a textured or patterned shirt. The character's arms are short and end in simple, rounded shapes. There is a tail-like appendage with a pointed end extending from the lower right side of the character.

The background of the artwork is plain, with no additional elements or shading. The overall style is whimsical and imaginative, with a focus on exaggerated facial features and expressive poses.
