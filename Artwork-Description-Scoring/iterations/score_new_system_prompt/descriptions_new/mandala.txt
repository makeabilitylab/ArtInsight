This artwork is a circular design resembling a mandala or stained glass pattern. The circle is outlined in black, and the design is divided into symmetrical sections with intricate details and vibrant colors.

Starting from the center, there is a small pink flower with five petals, outlined in black. Surrounding this flower is a green area with black lines forming a star-like pattern with pointed edges.

Moving outward, there are four large petal shapes, each filled with a gradient of colors. The top and bottom petals are colored in shades of yellow and orange, while the left and right petals are filled with blue and light purple. These petals are outlined in black and have a curved, flowing shape.

Between these large petals, there are smaller sections filled with red and pink colors. These sections have swirling patterns and are also outlined in black.

The outermost layer of the design features large, curved shapes filled with a deep pink color. These shapes have a flowing, wave-like appearance and are interspersed with smaller sections of red and pink.

Overall, the design is highly symmetrical and uses a combination of bold and pastel colors to create a vibrant and intricate pattern. The black outlines help to define each section and add to the stained glass effect. The artwork is held up by a hand, and the background appears to be a door with a white or light-colored surface.
