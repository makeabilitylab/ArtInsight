This artwork features a colorful and vibrant scene created on a digital platform, likely a tablet. The background is a light grey color, and the artwork is framed by a green border at the bottom, with a zigzag pattern along the top edge of the green section.

In the center of the image, there are two figures drawn with bold, bright lines. Both figures are primarily outlined in purple. The heads of the figures are circular, and each has two blue circles for eyes and a red curved line for a mouth. The bodies are composed of simple lines: straight lines for the torsos and limbs. The figures are positioned side by side, with their arms extending towards each other.

Above the figures, there is a large, irregularly shaped blue scribble, which could be interpreted as a cloud. To the right of this blue shape, there is a bright yellow sun, depicted with a circular center and several straight lines radiating outward.

To the right of the figures, there is a large flower. The flower has an orange circular center with pink scribbles inside it, and it is surrounded by orange petals. The stem and leaves of the flower are green.

At the bottom of the image, there is a green horizontal line that spans the width of the artwork, possibly representing grass or ground.

Overall, the artwork is lively and colorful, with a variety of bright colors and bold lines creating a cheerful scene.
