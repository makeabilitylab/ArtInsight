This artwork features a series of black paint strokes on a light beige background. The strokes are bold and vary in size and shape, creating an abstract composition. 

In the center of the artwork, there are two prominent sets of shapes that resemble faces. The face on the left has two large, oval-shaped black strokes for eyes, a smaller triangular stroke for a nose, and a curved line for a mouth. The face on the right also has two oval-shaped strokes for eyes, a smaller stroke for a nose, and a curved line for a mouth. Both faces are surrounded by additional black strokes that could be interpreted as hair or other features.

Above the faces, there are several vertical and diagonal black strokes, some of which are thicker and more textured. These strokes are clustered together, creating a sense of depth and layering.

Below the faces, there are larger, horizontal black strokes that are more spread out. These strokes are also textured and vary in thickness, adding to the overall abstract feel of the artwork.

The paint appears to have been applied with a brush, and the strokes have a textured appearance, with some areas showing more paint buildup and others appearing more transparent.

Overall, the artwork is a dynamic and expressive composition, with bold black strokes creating a striking contrast against the light background.
