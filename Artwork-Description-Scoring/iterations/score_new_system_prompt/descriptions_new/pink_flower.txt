This artwork features a large, vibrant flower as the central element, set against a blue background. The flower has a yellow circular center with several small brown spots scattered across it. Surrounding the center are ten petals, each colored in a rich purple hue with darker purple shading towards the base of the petals. The petals are outlined in black, giving them a distinct definition.

In the upper left corner of the artwork, there is a depiction of a sun. The sun is represented with a yellow circular center and green rays extending outward, blending slightly with the blue background.

The flower's stem is green and extends downward from the center of the flower to the bottom edge of the artwork. At the base of the stem, there are two green leaves, one on each side, also outlined in black.

The background is predominantly blue, with visible brush strokes creating a textured appearance. There are areas of white where the blue paint is lighter, adding depth to the background. The bottom edge of the artwork has a strip of green, suggesting a ground or grass area.

Overall, the composition is bright and colorful, with clear, bold lines and a cheerful use of color.
