This artwork is created on a white sheet of paper and features a combination of drawing and three-dimensional elements. Here is a detailed description:

**Overall Composition:**
The artwork is centered around a three-dimensional element that appears to be a basket filled with colorful pom-poms. Surrounding this central element are numerous red outlines of heart shapes and some additional drawn elements.

**Central Element:**
- The central feature is a basket made from a red circular base, likely constructed from a pipe cleaner or similar material. 
- The basket contains several pom-poms in various colors, including red, pink, green, and blue.
- A green pipe cleaner is attached to the basket, forming a handle that arches over the pom-poms.

**Background and Surrounding Elements:**
- The area around the basket is filled with red crayon scribbles, creating a textured background.
- Surrounding the central basket are numerous red heart outlines, drawn with a marker. These hearts are distributed evenly around the basket, forming a border-like pattern.
- On the left side of the paper, there is a vertical column of hearts, and on the right side, there is another column of hearts.
- At the top and bottom of the paper, there are additional hearts, creating a complete border around the central basket.
- Near the top left corner, there are small red dots arranged in a cluster.
- Below these dots, the word "mama" is written in red marker.

**Additional Details:**
- The hearts vary slightly in size but are generally uniform in shape.
- The red crayon scribbles within the central area are dense and cover a significant portion of the paper, providing a contrasting background to the white areas and the three-dimensional basket.
- The pom-poms in the basket are fluffy and add a tactile element to the artwork.

This artwork combines both two-dimensional drawing and three-dimensional crafting, showcasing a mix of colors and textures. The use of hearts and the word "mama" suggests a theme of affection or love.
