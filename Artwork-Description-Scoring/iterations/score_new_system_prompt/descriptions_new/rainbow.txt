This artwork features a colorful and vibrant scene. The primary elements include a rainbow, a sun, and a pot at the end of the rainbow, all set against a white background.

Starting from the top, a thick blue horizontal line runs along the upper edge of the paper, representing the sky. Below this, on the right side, there is a large yellow sun. The sun is depicted as a yellow circle with several straight yellow lines radiating outward, symbolizing sun rays.

The central focus of the artwork is a large rainbow that arches from the left side of the paper to the right. The rainbow consists of seven distinct, curved lines, each in a different color. From the outermost to the innermost, the colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and pink. Each line is drawn with a steady hand, creating a smooth and continuous arc.

At the bottom of the rainbow, on the right side of the paper, there is a black pot. The pot is solid black with a wide brim and a rounded base. On top of the pot, there are several small yellow circles, suggesting contents inside the pot.

The ground is represented by a thick green horizontal band that stretches across the bottom of the paper. The green area is filled with overlapping strokes, giving it a textured appearance.

Overall, the artwork is bright and cheerful, with a clear and organized composition. The use of vivid colors and distinct shapes makes each element stand out, creating a visually engaging piece.
