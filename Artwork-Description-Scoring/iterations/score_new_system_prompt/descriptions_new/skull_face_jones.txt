This artwork is drawn on a piece of white paper with a slightly uneven edge on the left side. The drawing is done entirely in pencil and features several distinct elements.

At the top left of the paper, there are two head-and-shoulders sketches of a character. The first sketch is a profile view of the character facing left. The character has short, slightly messy hair and a bandage on their cheek. The second sketch, positioned to the right of the first, shows the character facing forward. This character has a serious expression, with eyebrows drawn in a downward angle and a straight mouth. The hair is similar to the first sketch, and the character is wearing a high-collared shirt with two vertical lines on the collar.

Below these two sketches, there is a full-body drawing of a character. This character has curly hair and is wearing a mask that covers the lower half of their face. The mask has vertical lines that might represent teeth or a skeletal design. The character is dressed in a long-sleeved shirt with a strap crossing the chest, pants, and boots. They are holding a large, curved object in their right hand, which could be interpreted as a weapon or tool.

To the right of the full-body character, there is a vertical arrangement of text and additional drawings. The text reads "SKULL FACE JONES" in a stylized font. The word "SKULL" is written in large, angular letters, with the "U" designed to look like a skull. Below "SKULL," the word "FACE" is written in smaller, simpler letters. Below "FACE," the word "JONES" is written in a blocky, outlined font.

The background of the paper is plain, with no additional elements or shading. The overall composition is balanced, with the character sketches on the left and the text on the right, creating a clear and organized layout.
