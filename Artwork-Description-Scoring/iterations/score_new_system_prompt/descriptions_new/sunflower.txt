This artwork features a large, partially visible flower prominently displayed in the upper left corner of the paper. The flower has a round, brown center that is textured with a mix of dark and light brown shades. Surrounding the center are bright yellow petals, each outlined with an orange line. The petals are elongated and slightly pointed at the tips, with some showing subtle variations in shading to suggest depth.

The background of the artwork is filled with a rich blue color, applied with visible brush strokes that create a sense of movement and texture. The blue background varies in intensity, with some areas being lighter and others darker, adding a dynamic quality to the piece.

The paper itself appears to be mounted on a slightly larger yellow sheet, creating a thin yellow border around the artwork. This border frames the piece and adds an additional layer of color contrast.

Overall, the composition is vibrant and dynamic, with the bright yellow flower standing out against the deep blue background. The use of color and texture in both the flower and the background creates a visually engaging piece.
