The artwork features a stylized depiction of a bird, likely a turkey, created with bold black outlines and filled with various colors. The bird is centrally positioned and occupies most of the canvas. 

Starting from the top, the bird's head is a large oval shape, filled with a mix of brown and light brown watercolor. The eyes are prominent, consisting of two large white circles with smaller black circles in the center, giving the bird a wide-eyed look. Below the eyes, there is a green triangular shape representing the beak, with a red, teardrop-shaped wattle hanging from it.

The body of the bird is a large, rounded shape filled with a brown watercolor wash, similar to the head but slightly darker in some areas, giving it a textured appearance. 

The bird's tail feathers fan out behind its head and body, each feather outlined in black and filled with different colors. The feather on the left is filled with a gradient of yellow and orange, the next feather to the right is a mix of green and light green, the central feather is brown, the next feather is green with a swirl pattern, and the feather on the far right is a mix of pink and red. 

The background is divided into sections by the black outlines. The top section is filled with blue watercolor and has black dots scattered throughout. The sections on either side of the bird are filled with light green and pink watercolors, with some areas showing a gradient effect.

Overall, the artwork is vibrant and colorful, with a clear focus on the bird in the center. The use of bold black outlines and watercolor fills gives the piece a stained-glass-like appearance.
