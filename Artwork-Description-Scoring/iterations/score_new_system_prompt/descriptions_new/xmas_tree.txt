The artwork features a large, central triangular shape that resembles a Christmas tree. The tree is colored in with a yellowish-green crayon and is decorated with various circular ornaments in blue and green. The tree is outlined with a thick black line, and there are zigzag patterns along the edges, giving it a textured appearance.

At the top of the tree, there is a star-like shape drawn with black lines, and it has a looped design. Below the tree, there is a brown rectangular shape that appears to represent the tree trunk, with black lines creating a textured effect.

Surrounding the base of the tree are several gift boxes. These boxes are colored in green and pink, with some having a crisscross pattern to indicate ribbons. The gifts are outlined in black and are placed on both sides of the tree.

In the background, there are additional elements, including green shapes with blue diamond patterns and some blue areas that might represent water or a pond. These elements are scattered around the bottom of the artwork, adding more detail to the scene.

The entire composition is drawn on a white piece of paper, and the use of colors is vibrant and varied, creating a lively and festive atmosphere. The lines are bold and confident, giving the artwork a dynamic and energetic feel.
