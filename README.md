# ArtInsight

## Description

ArtInsight is an iOS app to support parents who are blind or have low-vision (BLV) to engage with their sighted childrenâ€™s artwork. The app includes an accessible camera view. When a photo of artwork is taken using the app, a description of the artwork is generated using GPT. Following findings from formative research, the app includes a human-in-the-loop system to support children and parents editing AI descriptions as they feel appropriate. Descriptions will be saved in the app for future reference.
